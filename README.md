<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>To use this script, you need to specify the target IP addresses in the ip_list. The script will then ping each IP address in the list and return whether the ping was successful or unsuccessful.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The script uses the os module to execute the Ping command in the command prompt. It then captures the output of the command to determine whether the Ping was successful or not.</p>
