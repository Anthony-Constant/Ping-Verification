## How to Use

To use this script, you need to specify the target IP addresses in the `ip_list`. The script will then ping each IP address in the list and return whether the ping was successful or unsuccessful.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.

## How It Works

The script uses the `os` module to execute the Ping command in the command prompt. It then captures the output of the command to determine whether the Ping was successful or not.
